# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Requirements

- NeoVim (>= 0.9.0)
- Git (>= 2.19.0)
- a Nerd Font (>= 3.0)
- a C compiler for nvim-treesitter
- node (>=18.0.0) for copilot
- Python (>= 3.6) for the codeforces tool

## Installation

```bash 
cd ~/.config/
git clone https://github.com/BerqiaMouad/Neovim-Setup.git nvim
cd nvim/mouad_codeforces_tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After you installed everything, now you just have to run the command `nvim` in your terminal and lazyvim will take care of all the plugins.

```bash
nvim
```

## Some important changes to make

You have to change one simple thing so that the codeforces tool works properly. You have to change the file `auth_codeforces.txt`:

```
your_codeforces_handle
your_codeforces_password
```

## Some important keybindings
